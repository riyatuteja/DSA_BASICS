LINKED LIST- is a linear data structure which stores list of values
           - works similar to array
           - multiple blocks of memory linked to each other
           - size can be modified
           - non-contiguous memory 
           - insertion & deletion at any pointer easier
        HEAD]
           1->2->3->4->NULL
ARRAY - single block of memory with partitions
      - fixed size
      - contiguous block of memory
      - insertion and deletion is costly
